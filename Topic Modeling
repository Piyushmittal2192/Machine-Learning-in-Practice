Topic Modeling : Clustering Technique. Unsupervised learning mechanism. Cluster documents and identify topics under which documents can be categorised into.

Latent means unobserved
Latent Variables means : unobserved variables in the feature space that can be seen via observed variables. 

LSA - Latent Semantic Analysis
it is based on Distributional hypothesis: linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings. 
  i.e. words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meanings.

Math - compute the word frequencies across all documents and assume that the similar documents will have similar word frequency distribution


LDA - Latent Dirchelet Analysis 
  - Each word in a Documnet is analysed. Documents having similar words are grouped together. 
  - i.e. find word frequency, group similar patterns/expressions/words occuring together, distance between words and cluster documents on these parameters.
